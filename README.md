# DMS Component Library

The objective of this repo is to consolidate various components I carry around with me in various systems and to offer some of them as standalone libraries, like Filter.

# Components

## Filter

The filter library is a standalone annotation based filter library for entities, it works very well alongside Symfony's Validator library.
